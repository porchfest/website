                        <h2>Play a Show</h2>
						<p class="large">You're looking to play a show at the 2017 West Philly Porchfest? Great! We'll walk you through the process.</p>
						<hr>
						<h3>Details</h3>
						<h4>"I live in a house with a porch and I want to play on it"</h4>
						<p>This is the easiest way to play at Porchfest. Plus, you get to make your own lineup and invite your friends to open for you. Register your porch at <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzWpNpmtMD5IRtsYjyuAdTtcsu04m0mM5Y42ueX-W6zVZAbw/viewform?c=0&w=1">Porchfest Registration Form</a>. And if you need help rounding out the bill, check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1609331765986927/">Porchfest Musician/Porch Connector</a> on Facebook to meet other acts that would love to play on your porch.
</p>
						<h4>"I don't have a porch but I still want to play"</h4>
						<p>We feel your pain. Some of the organizers donâ€™t have porches, either. Here are some recommended ways to play a show.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Convince that West Philly friend with a porch to host you and other bands. It's a lot of fun and a great way to meet other people in the community!</li>
							<li>Connect with show hosts looking for musicians over at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1609331765986927/">Porchfest Musician/Porch Connector</a>  on Facebook.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>"What else should I know?"</h4>
						<p>Some things to consider:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Do you need electricity and extension cords?</li>
							<li>If you have drums or a lot of gear for any acts... is there any gear sharing that can help save space and expedite transitions?</li>
							<li>Where will the audience be standing and is there a place for some people to sit?</li>
							<li>Have you told the neighbors? Even if the show isnâ€™t on your porch, make sure everyone on the block knows about Porchfest, specifically that there will be music and a crowd on their block. Also be clear with everyone what kind of music they can expect (especially if the music will be loud or amplified). </li>
							<li>All Porchfest shows are free BUT you can try to sell merch or make a soft ask for donations if people enjoyed the music. We do ask that you donâ€™t physically pass a donation vessel or make a harder ask than just having a jar available if people feel moved to donate.</li>
